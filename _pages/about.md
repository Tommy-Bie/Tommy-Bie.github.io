Hi! This is Yequan Bie's home on the web.



- I am now a Ph.D. student majoring in Computer Science and Engineering at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology ([HKUST](https://hkust.edu.hk)), under the supervision of  [Prof. Hao Chen](https://cse.hkust.edu.hk/~jhc/). I obtained my bachelor's degree in Intelligent Science and Technology at South China University of Technology ([SCUT](https://www.scut.edu.cn/en/)) with honor.
- I was a visiting student in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences at the University of California, Berkeley ([Cal](https://www.berkeley.edu)). I got an overall GPA of 4.0/4.0 and obtained Merit Scholarship during the semester at UC Berkeley.
- My research interest now is in Artificial Intelligence, especially Trustworthy/Explainable AI, Vision-Language Foundation Models, and Medical Image Analysis.
